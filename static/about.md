## An writer by night, and developer by day

- Hi, I’m Meet, also known as Mr. Destructive, mostly living life as a developer. My ego says to be a software developer, but my soul says to be a writer. I am on a war each day, balancing the devil ego with the angel soul. Both of them are helpful to me in one way or the other, one to get the basic needs, so the other can fulfil to the inner art to its content.

- I always had a instinct and glimpse of mother nature nudging me to be a writer, I still haven't found the right balance.

- Previously as a child or even a teenager, I have couple of short stories and a novella to my name. Not to say, those are publishable or complete in some way, but the knack of writing was always with me. Over the past 4 years, I have written 200+ technical articles, some dozens of mythical posts, and now feeling the urge to write my sould out.

- Who knows, where I will land, I don't know what I will write here, but something that I and someone atleast one person would enjoy, and If you are to be that person, I have done my dharma here.
